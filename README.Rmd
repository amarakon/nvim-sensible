# Introduction

Neovim's defaults are pretty good.
They are much better than Vim's at least.
But they could be improved, which is why I created this plugin.
It is inspired by [vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible), but
vim-sensible's changes are only useful to Vim users and not Neovim users because
Neovim is already more sensible than Vim.
Technically, you can use this plugin even if you are a Vim user, but it is
intended for Neovim users.
If you use Vim, I recommend installing both vim-sensible and Neovim Sensible.

## Mappings

### Completion

```{r, completion}
mode = c("Insert", "Insert")
key = c("Control-Space", "Control-L")
mapping = c("Omni complete", "Line complete")

completion = data.frame(mode, key, mapping)

kable(completion, col.name = c("Mode", "Key", "Mapping"))
```

### Clipboard

```{r, clipboard}
mode = c("Normal", "Normal", "Visual", "Visual")
key = c("Control-Y", "Control-P", "Shift-Y", "Shift-D")
mapping = c("Copy file contents to clipboard", "Paste from clipboard",
			"Copy to clipboard", "Cut to clipboard"
)

clipboard = data.frame(mode, key, mapping)

kable(clipboard, col.name = c("Mode", "Key", "Mapping"))
```

### Movement

```{r, movement}
mode = c("Insert", "Insert", "Insert")
key = c("Up", "Down", "Return")
mapping = c("Go up even when a completion menu is visible",
			"Go down even when a completion menu is visible",
			"Return even when a completion menu is visible"
)

movement = data.frame(mode, key, mapping)

kable(movement, col.name = c("Mode", "Key", "Mapping"))
```
